This project was although inneficient, poorly optimised and clumsy forged me into the proggrammer I am today, I had a tonsillectomy part
way through my A levels that set me back hugely on my coursework where I had to design and implement this project, and after losing that
time I descided to make it into a website with no prior experience, so built of my hazy understanding of OOP at the time (after a couple
years of only using python and visual basic, I jumped into the deep end, constructed a java class to make a DND character and then set it
up so it could be hosted on a google appengine website, using HTML, javascript, JSP and GQL for pretty much the first time, I worked 
solidly on this project for a month before it was finished, picking up languages and techniques on the fly. It was successful in as far as
you can use the site to make a character, but I grew hugely from the experience. I learnt a lot about quickly learning to use a language to 
solve problems, made huge mistakes(that work!) in the form of javascript files for generating dynamic radio buttons that took thousands 
upon thousands of lines that in the end could have been easily replicated with a little Jquery had I done more research. I learnt about
hashing passwords and avoiding SQL injection the hard way, propper class inheritance, using Enums, using private variables with getter 
and setter methods rather than public variables, the meaning of static methods and much much more over a very short period of time. 
From this project my approach to problem solving and software design was forged, it is not good code, but it is important.
